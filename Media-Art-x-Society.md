- Dewey Hagbord “Stranger Visions”(2012)

**(privacy, DNA)**
In Stranger Visions I collected hairs, chewed up gum, and cigarette butts from the streets, public bathrooms and waiting rooms of New York City. I extracted DNA from them and analyzed it to computationally generate 3d printed life size full color portraits representing what those individuals might look like, based on genomic research. Working with the traces strangers unwittingly left behind, the project was meant to call attention to the developing technology of forensic DNA phenotyping, the potential for a culture of biological surveillance, and the impulse towards genetic determinism.

- Kyle Mcdonald “People Staring at Computers”(2011)

(**privacy, surveillance)**
“*People Staring at Computers”* started as a photographic intervention exploring computer-mediated interaction and turned into a large-scale collaboration with Apple Inc. and the United States secret service, dealing with themes of privacy and surveillance. The work emerged from a brief “sousveillance” project that highlighted the empty expression people wear when using computers. In order to portray this expression more accurately and share it with others, the portraits of unsuspecting customers were captured at two Apple stores in New York. Custom software was installed manually on dozens of computers over several days, taking pictures once a minute and sending them back to a central server for exhibition online. On the final day the photos were exhibited simultaneously on all the computers at the Apple store at the site where they were taken.

(**privacy)**
*Memopol-II* is a social machine that maps the visitor’s information field. By inserting an identification document such as a national ID card or EU passport into the machine, it starts collecting information about the visitor from (inter)national databases and the Internet. The data is then visualized on a large‐scale custom display. The collection panel also shows the portraits of the visitors from their ID card.

- **Niklas Roy My little piece of privacy(2010)**

(**privacy)**
*My workshop is located in an old storefront with a big window facing towards the street. In an attempt to create more privacy inside, I’ve decided to install a small but smart curtain in that window. The curtain is smaller than the window, but an additional surveillance camera and an old laptop provide it with intelligence: The computer sees the pedestrians and locates them. With a motor attached, it positions the curtain exactly where the pedestrians are.*
